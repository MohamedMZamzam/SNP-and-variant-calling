### Files and datasets
1. Data files: starts with sorted bam file that is generated after mapping reads to reference genome: For this step (to get that sorted bam file), see repository  [RNA-Seq_Rice](https://github.com/MohamedMZamzam/RNA-Seq_Rice)
2.  Reference genome is Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0 (IRGSP-1.0_genome.fasta) [download from here](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
